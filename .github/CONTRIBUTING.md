We'd love for you to contribute to the **[@gorilla](https://github.com/gorilla)** packages, as long as you keep in mind a few useful rules-of-thumb:

* Open a brief proposal (use the "Feature Request" template) discussing your idea _before_ you start implementing! We can't accept every change to the API, as the Gorilla Toolkit is widely used by users of all kinds.
* Be prepared to write (or ask for help with!) writing/updating tests: we want to make sure things work, and good tests help cover edge cases & prevent regressions. In many cases, they also help demonstrate usage of the feature!
* Work with us on adding documentation for your proposal - to the `README`, as godoc comments, and as part of the release changelog/good commit messages.
