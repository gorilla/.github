ü¶ç A helpful toolkit for building HTTP-based applications with the Go programming language.

## Announcement

We were going to wait until the transition was complete to make an announcement, but it seems that the cat is out of the bag...

We are excited to confirm that the Gorilla web toolkit project has a new group of Core Maintainers!

We are all thrilled by the positive response from the community so far. Here is a list of what we are currently working on to complete the transition process:
* Updating the project to support the latest Go version
* Implementing GitHub features such as Branch Protection, GitHub Actions, and more.
* Updating documentation for contributing, code of conduct, reporting vulnerabilities, etc.

To address many comments that we have seen - we would like to clarify that Red Hat is not taking over this project. While the new Core Maintainers all happen to work at Red Hat, our hope is that developers from many different organizations and backgrounds will join the project over time.

We are hoping to have the transition completed by the end of July, 2023. You can follow our progress by watching for updates at the following locations:

* https://github.com/gorilla
* https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/
* https://groups.google.com/g/gorilla-web

Thank you for your support and we look forward to collaborating with the community!
